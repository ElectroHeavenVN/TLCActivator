## Download
- If you want to download the entire source code, you can clone this repo using either [git](https://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop).
- If you want to download the compiled version, you can download it in the [Release](../../releases/latest/) section.
## User guide
- Prepare the original file to proceed with license activation. [^1]
- Run the `TLCActivator.GUI.exe` program.
- Select the Account Manager file either by drag-and-drop, click the Browse file button (`...`) or enter the file path in the text field.
- Select the product name from the drop-down list.
- Click `Run`. A console window will appear. If after 1-2 seconds this window shows `Injection succeeded.` it means the activation was successful. Otherwise, try starting the Account Manager first for about 5 seconds, then exit before trying again.
- *<u>(Optional)</u>*: Click `Save shortcut` to save a shortcut to `TLCActivator.Injector.exe` with the command line arguments pre-populated in the location you want. Launching `TLCActivator.Injector.exe` via this shortcut will automatically open the Account Manager and activate the license.
